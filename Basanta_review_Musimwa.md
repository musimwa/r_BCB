﻿# Assignment Review## Basanta BistaI think you did a great job doing the assignment.The files you made for each chromosomes looks good but they do not have all the headings intactwhich mean we do not know the site wheere the polymorphism is happening.  I would imagine that for further use of the files you created we would require the headings as well. Also, the filename and extensions are a little wonky.  Your description are very thorough and detailed.  You have very interesting graphs. The plot for homozygotes and heterozygotes per sample_ID is a little crowded and hard to understand.  For your last graph, the labels are not quite right. Other than that I have no complains.It was a job well done. Best,  Basanta
